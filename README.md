# DeckBuilder

## Description
A fullstack Pokemon Trading Card Game deckbuilding and mock social media application. Users can build their own Pokemon Decks, review other users' decks, and post comments. Originally a group project built at the end of my bootcamp, I have since refactored the codebase, added additional features, and updated styling. Currently configured to include Gen 1 pokemon cards, the allowable cards can be updated on the backend.

## Tech
The front end was built with a system of pages and components using React JS. All styling was done with vanilla CSS in order to practice fundamentals and allow maximum flexibilty. The backend was built with NodeJS, with Express being used for routing and APIs. Prisma ORM was used to set up and interact with a PostgreSQL database.
